/* CSS Units*/

/* Absolute Units

    1. Absolute units are those that are always the same in any context
    2. px is an absolute unit because the size of a pixel doesnt change realtive to anything else on the page
    3. px is the only absolute unit that should be used for web development

    Examples of absolute units:
    1. px - pixels
    2. cm - centimeters 
    3. mm - millimeters

*/

/* Relative Units

    Relative units change based on their context, examples include::after

    === em and rem ===
    1. em and rem refer to a font size
    2. 1em is the font-size of the parent element, therefore a font-size of 16px would equal 1em, 4em would equal 64px
    3. 1rem is the font-size of the root element (:root or html), the maths for the px is the same as em
    4. rem is recommended for websites with websites allowing users to change base font-size

    === viewport units ===
    1. vh and vw refer to the size of the viewport
    2. 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height
    3. 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width
    4. useful for creating things based on the size of the screen, including full-height hero sections or a full screen app interface

    Examples of relative units:
    1. em - relative to the parent element's font-size
    2. rem - relative to the root font-size
    3. vh - relative to 1% of the viewport's height
    4. vw - relative to 1% of the viewport's width
    5. % - relative to the parent element
